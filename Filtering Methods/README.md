Any pixel for which the convolution extends outside the image boundary (sometimes
called “edge cases”) should be given an output value of zero.


A. Convolution using basic 2D 7x7 mean filter.

B. Separable filters (1x7 and 7x1)
In separable filters. We have to apply vertical and horizontal filter separately meaning first apply
vertical or horizontal filter on provided image and then apply remaining filter on the image
generated by the first filter. We can apply any filters first because of the associativity of the
convolution.

C. Separable filter with sliding window
This can be done by combining separable filter and sliding window. As we know during
convolution the mean filter running in for loop with increment of one.

We can see all images are exactly the same after smoothing
